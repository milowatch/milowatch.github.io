# Milo Yiannopoulos is a danger to campus safety
Milo Yiannopoulos recently used a campus talk to [out a transgender student](http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/12/milo-yiannopoulos-harassed-a-trans-student-at-uw-milwaukee.html), opening her up for harassment. She has since [left the school](http://www.themarysue.com/milo-yiannopoulos-university-apology/).

# In his own words
* ["...we need to make America hate again."](http://archive.is/2vSLJ)
* ["Women are — and you won’t hear this anywhere else — screwing up the internet for men by invading every space we have online and ruining it with attention-seeking and a needy, demanding, touchy-feely form of modern feminism that quickly comes into conflict with men’s natural tendency to be boisterous, confrontational and delightfully autistic."](http://archive.is/bSBGL)
* ["Made-up genders don’t make you special, they make you a retard."](http://archive.is/oNL2f)
* ["...it stands to reason that looking at fat, ugly people depresses testosterone. This is certainly how any red-blooded man feels when looking at a hamplanet."](http://archive.is/NAFms)
* ["Fat people should hate themselves."](http://archive.is/WIfA4)
* ["Some universities have a policy of affirmative [sexual] consent that requires a “yes” every 10 minutes. First of all, gross."](http://archive.is/2Rupq)

# Milo Yiannopoulos backed a hate group
Milo Yiannopoulos [saw an opportunity in GamerGate](http://www.salon.com/2014/10/28/gamergates_fickle_hero_the_dark_opportunism_of_breitbarts_milo_yiannopoulos/), a [hate campaign](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2015/04/28/gamergate/) focused on harassing, threatening and otherwise intimidating women and people of color in the video games industry. 
Before Yiannopoulos got [banned from Twitter](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/twitter-just-permanently-suspended-conservative-writer-milo?utm_term=.nuRAp2lLw#.aqk1YJkWK) for encouraging a [racist hate mob](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/07/21/what-it-takes-to-get-banned-from-twitter/), he was well known for the harassment mobs he would send on his critics.

# Milo Yiannopoulos is unethical
If his misogynist, transphobic, racist history isn't enough for you, well, Yiannopoulos raised money for a "scholarship" that he [deposited into his own bank account](http://www.mediaite.com/online/breitbarts-milo-yiannopoulos-raised-100k-for-charity-deposits-it-in-his-bank-account/); he also [failed to pay his employees on time and then tried to blackmail them](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/mar/01/the-kernel). He [doesn't even write his own articles.]
